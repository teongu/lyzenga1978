"""
This module performs the water column correction as described in Lyzenga 1978. 

The implementation is strongly inspired from the work of @jkibele, some functions are directly his work (https://github.com/jkibele/OpticalRS/blob/master/OpticalRS/Lyzenga1978.py) but some modifications have been made. 

You can find an example of how to use this code in the notebook "Lyzenga 1978 demo.ipynb".

In the following documents, `N` stands for the number of bands.
